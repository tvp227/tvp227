Swiss army knife of Sentinel Content management with multiple tools encapsulated into a tkinter GUI, ranging from ARM template concatanation to make them easily deployable into different subscriptions, to documentation aids for automatically generating read.me files for your sentinel content and much more.

### [XPNC Auto](https://github.com/tvp227/xpncAuto) 
I worked as a contracted security analyst in london for 6 months and would often have to create expense forms in excel to cover my train tickets. I scripted some python that uses tesseract OCR capture to upload the train tickets and manually plot the data in an excel sheet.

### [SnapInstaller](https://github.com/tvp227/SnapInstaller) 
I was a massive fan of ninite on windows systems for mass installing apps on a fresh build. Wanted something similar for linux using the snap store. If youre anything like me and change distros all the time this is a great alteranative to ninite.
